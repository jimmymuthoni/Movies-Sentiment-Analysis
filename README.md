# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project is a web application that performs **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The application is built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for machine learning and is deployed as a user-friendly interface via **Streamlit**.

## Features

- **Sentiment Prediction**: Predicts whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative**.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Leverages **Simple RNN** for text analysis and sentiment classification.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Provides a simple and accessible interface via **Streamlit**.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Input movie reviews and get predictions instantly.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Natural Language Processing**: Tokenization, Embedding layers
- **Web Deployment Framework**: Streamlit
- **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
